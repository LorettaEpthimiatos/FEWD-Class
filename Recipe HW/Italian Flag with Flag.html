    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Italian Greens and Beans has it all: it's very easy and inexpensive to make; it's highly nutritious; it's soulful and comforting; and it can be served as a main course, side dish, soup, or vegtable stew. My favorite way to serve this meal is as a main course with some Tuscan bread and oil.</p>
